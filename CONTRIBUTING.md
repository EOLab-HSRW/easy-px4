# Contributing to `easy_px4`


- `easy_px4`: the cli and automation.
- `easy_px4_utils` (release as a standalone pip package): Parser. Run validation for filenames and key-values in `info.toml`.

Harley: I need to add more info here.

Keep in mind that this would install PX4 toolchain locally in your machine:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/EOLab-HSRW/easy-px4.git@main#egg=easy_px4
```
